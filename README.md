# encryption-and-decryption-of-files
<p>What we are doing is,<br>
   Encrypting and Decrypting of various types of files using python and a comination of various encryption and decryption models available .We are more focused on "Symmetric Encryption" models which would be :
   <br>
  <br>
  1.AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)   
  <br>
  
  2.DES (Data Encryption Standard)
  <br>
  3.3DES (Triple DES)
  <br>
  4.RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)
